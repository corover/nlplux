### AI/ML based document content classifiaction

In this project we are aiming to help user to classify a given pdf document with the help of AI/ML, understand the gist of the document and on top of that will generate questions and answers accordingly on its own.

Users can provide a document and the system will analyse and in return will give a list of question answers using AI/ML.

The project is open source, so anyone is welcome to contribute to its development or use the code for their own wellness-related projects. The project's code and assets are available on GitHub, along with instructions on how to set up and use the application.
